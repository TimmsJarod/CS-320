Week Eight Journal

Through this course, I learned a great deal about software testing to ensure quality assurance and methods of using modern automation to make the process easier and more efficient. I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by first understanding my test cases and gaining an understanding of potential vulnerabilities in my code and use that information for when I begin creating files to test my work. I can also think ahead by drafting ways of tackling software requirements in efficient manners. 

The best way to interpret user needs would be to create clear and detailed documentation by interfacing directly with clients and breaking down problems into solutions in group meetings. Once solutions are crafted into comprehensive features that the product should include to solve the problems of the users; work can begin to realize those features in a technical environment where programming begins.

I approach designing software in any method that provides the best chance that the product will be as useful as it can be, simple to understand, and designed using best practice standards to maximize its potential to be adjusted, modified, built on, and easily tested for vulnerabilities when possible.
